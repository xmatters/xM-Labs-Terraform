# Simple, One-way Integration To Send xMatters Notifications From Terraform (OSSS, the Open Source version)
This is a simple one-way integration to enable you to fire notifications and alerts from within your Terraform scripts, for example when a new EC2 instance is successfully deployed.


I call it an integration but it's more the methodology to enable you to join the two systems together.

# How it works

The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is simply known as a Terraform configuration, when you 'run' them they do stuff.  One of the things you can do as part of that configuration is run a local command... we use that to run a CURL command to trigger an integration in xMatters.

The information on what's sent and to whom etc is all put into the Terraform configuration script, there's a possibility that could use the variables and properties within the script but for my example I've hard coded the information.



# Pre-Requisites

* Terraform installed on a server
* An xMatters account


# Files

* [Terraform.zip](Terraform.zip) - The workflow (that has all the scripts and such).


# Installation


## The set up (xMatters)

1. Install the Terraform workflow attached.
2. Edit the Terraform Message form, remove voice call (I haven't set much of a format for this, you could spruce it up yourself).  You don't need a recipient on this one, that will be passed through by the Terraform script. Set to Web Service only.
3. Head into Integration Builder and find the Terraform Incoming inbound integration script and copy the URL for triggering the integration. 

## The set up (Terraform)

Your Terraform configuration (script) will look something like this:

```
provider "aws" { 
  access_key = "myaccesskey" 
  secret_key = "mysecretkey" 
  region = "us-east-1" 
} 

resource "aws_instance" "example" { 
  ami = "ami-c998b6b2" 
  instance_type = "t2.micro" 
  
 }
 ```

Into the resource section you add the local CURL command, however you can't just paste the one from xMatters as it needs to be a single line of code and have the quotes escaped etc, like this:

```
provisioner "local-exec" { command = "curl --request POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\"properties\": {\"message\": \"The message you want to send\",\"subject\": \"The message subject\"},\"recipients\":[\"xMattersusername orgroupname\"]}' \"https://mydomain.xmatters.com/api/integration/1/functions/a1d8e257-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-fd5df7f48606/triggers?apiKey=myxMattersapikey\"" }
```

So you want to ensure the message text, subject,recipient(s) and URL (the one you copied from the Integration Builder, including the API key) are all correct, be especially careful not to delete the escaping backslashes.

So in my example this will look like:

```
provider "aws" { 
  access_key = "myaccesskey" 
  secret_key = "mysecretkey" 
  region = "us-east-1" 
} 

resource "aws_instance" "example" { 
  ami = "ami-c998b6b2" 
  instance_type = "t2.micro" 

provisioner "local-exec" { command = "curl --request POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\"properties\": {\"message\": \"The message you want to send\",\"subject\": \"The message subject\"},\"recipients\":[\"xMattersusername orgroupname\"]}' \"https://mydomain.xmatters.com/api/integration/1/functions/a1d8e257-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-fd5df7f48606/triggers?apiKey=myxMattersapikey\"" }
  
 }
 ``` 

Again, note that provisioner line is a single line right up to the `apikey\"" }`

When you run your configuration (terraform apply) it should trigger xMatters to send push notifications, SMSs and emails all automatically!



# Testing

Apply your configuration in terraform using terraform apply (once you've done the whole init and plan bits), which will go build your EC2 instance or whatever.  At the appropriate stage it will trigger xMatters and send out your notification!


# Troubleshooting

Check the activity stream on the inbound integration.
If you're still stuck, reach out to an xPert.
